# My Plan For Learning

**_Each learning block will be in it's own repository._**

## 4 Blocks

- Block A: Academic
- Block B: Books
- Block C: Courses
- Block D: Daily Problems

## Learning Pathway

- Block A will be undertaken parallel to Block C, as they are both designed to introduce new concepts along the way.
- Studying the flashcards can start as soon as the first topic has been completed.
  - These will then be continuously be reviewed.
- Once Block A is completed and all the topics and their notes / flash cards have been taken. Both Block B and D will both start in parallel.


```
Crude view of how the learning blocks will be implemented.

### Block A: Academic

1. Watch a video on a topic from the README list.
    - Create a new file for that topic.
    - Go through the videos and take notes.
2. Read chosen book on the current topic.
    - I'm choosing to learn from a book that covers my chosen language.
      - i.e.: [Data Structures and Algorithms in Python](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/1118290275/?coliid=I2UAW1FZOYK6Q7&colid=2NAR5S91CCOPB&psc=1&ref_=lv_ov_lig_dp_it)
    - Take notes on a separate document.
3. Compare notes taken from both the videos and book on the topic.
    - Make any necessary corrections, clarifications and note examples.
    - Combining the notes on one master document.
4. Create flash cards on the topic from the notes.
    - I've chosen to do this on Anki.
5. If relevant, create an example implementation using an IDE.
    - This will be the fallback to work though with notes, if I ever get stuck.
6. As best as I can go through the implementation using a whiteboard.
    - Trying as best as I can to not rely on notes, and perfect examples.
    - If I ever get stuck, review notes and flash cards to see if there was anythign missing or incorrect.

**Move onto the next topic and repeat process.**

### Block B: Books

Going through the interviewing specific books, one chapter at a time.

1. Read through matching chapters from each book.
    - My choices for this path will be;
      - [Programming Interviews Exposed: Coding Your Way Through the Interview](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/111941847X/?coliid=I35ZHCXDEB4BDQ&colid=2NAR5S91CCOPB&psc=1&ref_=lv_ov_lig_dp_it)
      - [Cracking the Coding Interview](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/0984782850/?coliid=I1DWMLLYJG20D0&colid=2NAR5S91CCOPB&psc=1&ref_=lv_ov_lig_dp_it)
      - [Elements of Programming Interviews in Python: The Insiders' Guide](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/1537713949/?coliid=I1X5YNJTQH5WB3&colid=2NAR5S91CCOPB&psc=1&ref_=lv_ov_lig_dp_it)
2. Take notes from each book at a time if they cover the same topic.
    - Keep notes for each book on the same document, below one another.
3. Compare and review notes taken.
    - Corrections in methodology, clarification on information given.
4. Add to, adjust and update flash cards.
    - Might be necessary to separate technical, behavioural and miscellaneous card decks.
5. Go through and attempt to answer the questions asked at the each of each chapter.
    - Initially whiteboarding your logic.
    - Compare to any provided model once happy that I've come to an answer.
    - Type up model answers to add to a reference repository.

**Move onto the next chapter and repeat process.**

### Block C: Courses

1. Go through each selected course.
    - My order is as follows;
      - [Python for Data Structures, Algorithms, and Interviews!](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-for-data-structures-algorithms-and-interviews/)
      - [Intro to Data Structures and Algorithms](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-structures-and-algorithms-in-python--ud513)
      - [Software Engineer Interview Unleashed](https://www.udemy.com/course/software-engineer-interview-unleashed/)
      - [Grokking the Behavioral Interview](https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-the-behavioral-interview)
      - [Data Structures & Algorithms](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-structures-and-algorithms-nanodegree--nd256)
2. Take notes where appropriate.
    - Prioritise completing the course as intended. This may mean note taking isn't useful.
3. Review notes that taken after each section.
4. Create flash cards if necessary.
    - Continuing to refine the flash card deck, used for continuous reviewal.

**Move onto the next course and repeat process.**

### Block D: Daily Problems

1. Sign up to a coding problem website.
    - Use whatever one you prefer.
    - My choices are narrowed down to;
      - [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/)
      - [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/)
      - [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/)
2. Complete problem on whiteboard first.
3. Use notes / flash cards if necessary.
    - Do they need adding to?
    - This will once again make sure that notes and flash cards are refined.
4. Fill in the answer.

**Move onto the next problem and repeat process.**
