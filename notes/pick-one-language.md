# Pick One Language for the Interview

- [Choosing a Programming Language for Interviews](http://blog.codingforinterviews.com/best-programming-language-jobs/)

1. Use a language you're comfortable with.
2. Use a language that the interviewer will understand.

### General Recommendations

If the interview is language agnostic:
- C
- C++
- C#
- Java
- Python
- JavaScript
- Ruby (although it's falling out of favour)

Only learn to use other languages if the interview / job requires the use of said language.

Whenever your code involves something that is specific to that language. Just include an explanation of it when going through your algorithm's structure.

### Python

**_My choice_** - rsHalford

#### Practice

- Initialising and using has-backed maps (dictionaries) and sets.
- Performing queue and stack operations.
- Defining classes with contructors and attributes, static and instance methods, and defining a subclass and interface.
- Throwing exceptions for;
  - Invalid input.
  - Custom messages.
- Iterating through arrays and dictionaries.
  - Including iterate while maintaining an index (enumerate).
- Casting between strings and integers.
- Strings: get character at index, get range, concatenate.
- Initialising 2D arrays.
- Arithmetic:
  - Modulus (remainder).
  - Division (if the first operand is an interger, will it round the result to an integer?)
  - Rounding (ceiling and floor).
- Switch statements.
- Built-in language sorting.
  - Quickly defining a comparator to sort an array.
- The 5 standard bit manipulation operations.
  - L/R shift: << >>
  - AND: &
  - OR: |
  - NOT: ~
  - XOR: ^

#### Opinions

- What do you like about your chosen language?
- What don't you like?
- How does it compare to other languages you have experience using?
