#### Are you passionate enough about your work to share it?

- Open source: Push projects to the public and contribute to others.
- Publish your work: Medium, Personal blog and GitHub.
- Social media: Twitter, LinkedIn, Discord?
- Meetups: Go to where you want to work or they do something that interests you.
- Be somewhere for recruiters to find you, so they can reach out.


#### Stages of recruitment

Example: Facebook

1. Recruiter screen
    - Get told about the project, work-life balance, timeline, etc.
    - You will tell them about your passion.
    - What you've been doing, and if that's something you're passionate about.
    - If you're not passionate about it, are you looking for something else?
    - You're not a candiadate yet. You're not in the process yet. This is an informal introduction.
2. Technical screen
    - This stage will last approx. 45 minutes.
    - Prior to this stage the recruiter will provide prep material.
    - Coding through collaborative document (probably google docs).
    - Asked 1-3 questions.
    - Chance to ask questions at the end
    - Engineer will then pass feedback to the recruiter.
3. Onsite interview
    - Recruiter will be your host around the company.
    - Meeting with 4 different engineers.
    - Opportunity to find out what really matters to you
      - i.e. Work-life balance; a specific project; commute time
    - Coding is all done on a [whiteboard](#whiteboarding).
      - Want to be able to see if you can build from scratch.
    - After the interview, engineers submit feedback privately.
    - Using all of this information, the hiring manager and recruiter will put together an interiew debrief.
4. Interviewer debrief
    - All of the interviewers throughout the process come together and discuss the cadidate's feedback.
    - Some companies combine interviewer debrief and candidate review together.
5. Candidate review
    - An objective review of all the feedback with engineer's not involved in the interviewing process.
    - This determines whether you will be given an offer or not.
    - Using your resume, interviewer feedback, references.
6. Offer
    - The recruiter is present throughout each process.
    - Make them advocate for you, by forming a bond with them through the stages 1-3.

#### Takeaways

- Connect and be discoverable. Make the recruiters job easy.
- Prepare. Interviewing is a skill. Commit to the process.
- Know that the recruiter is there to not only find people who qualified for the position, but want to be there.

Regardless of the outcome of the process. Learn from it. You've not only put in the time to get the information to do your best at the interview. You've also just gained some more experience doing so. Take that with you going forward.

### [How to get a job at the Big 4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJZCUhxNCv8)

#### Step One: Get an interview

##### Resume

  - Not longer than one page.
  - Contact information.
  - Experience: Place, position, date, achievements.
  - Projects: Name, date, format, objectives and key outcomes.
  - Education: Place, course, date.
  - Technical skills: Programming languages, databases, devops.

##### Programming Challenges

  - Look out for tech companies putting out coding challenges.
  - Helping test yourself to create unique challenging projects.
  - Then you could use these to either interview at that company, or use as experience and something for you resume.

##### Referals

  - If you know someone at the company, ask nicely for a referal.
  - Even recruiters. As they gain to benefit from companies hiring you from their referal.

#### Step Two: Do well on the interview

##### Coding Interview Books

- Cracking the Coding Interview (6th Edt. - McDowell - 2015)
- Programming Interview Exposed (Mongan, Giguere, Suojanen - 2012)

##### Websites to Learn From

- [Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.com/) for interview questions.
- [Careercup](https://www.careercup.com/).
- [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/).
- [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/).
- [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/).
- [TOPCODER](https://www.topcoder.com/).

##### Mock Interviews

- Groups of 2-3.
- Interviewee:
    - Ask questions to remove ambiguity.
    - Discuss high level approach.
    - Annunciate thought process as you code.
- Interviewer:
    - Pick their head for what they know.
    - Guide them if they get lost.

**You're training for all the job interviews you will apply for in your career. Regardless of if you get the job you're applying for next. Or have to wait a year until you're finally hired.**

___

### [Cracking the Coding Interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEJzOhC5ZtQ)

#### How You Are Judged

##### How did you do relative to other candidates on the same question?

  - Not about how quickly you solved the problem.
  - It's about how quickly you solved it relative to other candidates.
  - Comparing other factors, suc as mistakes made.
  - Don't judge it based on how the interviewer reacts to you.

#### Resumes and Application Process

##### How to Get an Interview

1. Build something.
    - Don't waste your summers (or free time).
2. Make a "kick-ass" resume.
    - It's simple.

##### How Resumes are Reviewed

1. Pull resume out of a giant stack.
2. Spot-check: company names, positions, projects, schools.
3. Skim bullets to see if you've written real code.

Steps 1-3 take 15-30 seconds, and are followed by either a rejection or interview.

4. Repeat.

##### How a CS Resume Should Look

- Cover letter only if required.
  - Your message, email, phone call reaching out to a recruiter **is** your cover letter.
- One page only.
  - Unless >10 years exp.
  - No objectives or summaries.
- A real resume format.
  - With organised columns.
  - Keep a linear structure.
- Short.
  - 1-2 lines per bullet.
- Focus on accomplishments.
  - Not responsibilities.
- GPA (grade) if at least >3.0 (2:1).
- 3-4 projects.
  - Courses and independent.
  - Finished and unfinished.
- List of technical skills.
  - Keep it short, and just name them. No "fluff."
  - No one cares about MS Office, or your interpersonal skills.
  - Only show soft skills if they can be quantified.

##### Communication Tips

###### Goals
- Answer the question.
  - If you can't match the question, at least speak coherently.
- Deliver a **good** answer.
- Communicate well.
- Preparing for Behavioural Questions
  - Create a preparation grid for projects.
   
  |                   | Project One | Project Two |
  | ----------------- | ----------- | ----------- |
  | Enjoyed           |             |             |
  | Hated             |             |             |
  | Most Challenging  |             |             |
  | Hardest Bug       |             |             |
  |                   |             |             |
  | Mistakes          |             |             |
  | Challenges        |             |             |
  | Influence People  |             |             |
  | Conflict Response |             |             |

  - Prepare to ask them questions. Write up a list of questions you want answering before-hand. These fall into two type:
    - Things you actually want to know.
    - Things that just make you sound good.
        - Their technology, design decisions, their influence.
        - How many meetings do you have per week?
        - How do you spend your typical day?
        - How do decisions get made? Who will lead me? An actual developer?

###### Strategies
Nugget first.
- Lead with your "thesis" / nugget.
  - Grabs the listener's attention.
  - Gives them context for where you're going.
- Example:
  - Question: "What accomplishment's are you most proud of?"
  - Answer: "I'm most proud of the way I re-architected the..."

S.A.R.
- Situation: What was the issue?
- Action: What did you do about it?
- Result: What was the impact?

#### Technical Skills and Interview Preparation

##### How to Study

- Textbooks (e.g. CLRS) are probably overkill for the interview.
  - Interviewer will probably not remember this information.
  - Interviewer will want to know your aptitude not you knowledge.
- Write on paper/whiteboard and not in an IDE.
  - Even test it on paper first. Similar to an interview.

###### Data Structures

- How to implement.
- When to use (pros / cons).
- Hashtables are the most common to come up in interviews.

|              |        |            |
| ------------ | ------ | ---------- |
| Linked Lists | Stacks | Queues     |
| Trees        | Tries  | Graphs     |
| Vectors      | Heaps  | Hashtables |

###### Algorithms

- How to implement.
- Space vs Time Complexity.
- Most important are Tree Insert / Find and Depth-First Search.

|                      |                    |
| -------------------- | ------------------ |
| Quick Sort           | Merge Sort         |
| Tree Insert / Find   | Binary Search      |
| Breadth-First Search | Depth-First Search |

###### Concepts

- Not just a concept - know how to code.
- Even if your chosen language doesn't wor directly with it. Practice the concepts by hand.
  - i.e. Bit manipulation, Memory management.

|           |                              |                   |
| --------- | ---------------------------- | ----------------- |
| Threading | System Design & Scalability  | Memory Management |
| Recursion | Probability & Combinatronics | Bit Manipulation  |

##### Types of Interview Questions

###### Coding & Algorithms

1. Pattern Matching
    - Compare to similar problems.
    - Question: Write code to reverse the order of words in a sentence.
      - "dogs are cute"
      - "cute are dogs"
    - Similar to: reverse characters in a string.
      - "dogs are cute"
      - "etuc era sgod"
    - Answer: Reverse full string, then reverse each word.
2. Simplify & Generalise
    - Solve first for a simplified / tweaked problem.
    - Question: Design algorithm to figure out if you can build a ransom note (array of strings) from a magazine (array of strings).
    - Simplify: What if we used characters instead of strings?
      - Build array of character frequencies.
    - Generalise: How we can extend answer to words?
    - Answer: Build hashtable from word to frequency.
3. Base Case & Build
    - Solve for `n=1`, and build solution for `n=2`.
    - Question: Design algorithm to print subsets of set.

    ```
    {a,b,c}    ->    {},{a},{b},{c},{a,b},{a,c},{b,c},{a,b,c},
    S({})      ->    {}
    S({a})     ->    {},{a}
    S({a,b})   ->    {},{a},{b},{a,b},
    S({a,b,c}) ->    ?
    ```

    - Answer: Build S(n) by cloning S(n-1) and adding n to the cloned sets.
4. Data Structure Brainstorm
    - Try to apply data structure to solve problem.
    - Question: There are 10<sup>10</sup> possible phone #s. Explain how you could efficiently implement assignSpecificNum(num) and assignAnyAvailableNum().
      - Array (sorted)?: Too slow to remove num.
      - Linked list?: Too slow to find specific num.
      - Hash table?: Can't iterate through free nums.
    - Answer: Store free #s in Binary Search Tree. Remove when taken.

###### Object Oriented Design

1. Handle ambiguity.
    - What about the question is ambiguous?
2. Design the core objects.
    - What are the main objects in the system?
3. Analyse relationships.
    - How are the objects related to each other?
4. Investigate actions.
    - What are the main operations?

Question: How would you design the data structures and objects for a restaurant?

1. Is it a single restaurant, or part of a chain?
2. Guest, Party, Table, Server, Host, etc.
3. **Server** and **Host** are both **Employees**.
    - **Employee** class
    - **Party** has an array of each **Guest**.
4. A **Party** is seated at a **Table** by a **Host**.
    - How do you know what **Tables** are availble for **Party**?

###### System Design

1. Handle ambiguity.
    - What about hte question is ambiguous?
2. Make believe.
    - Pretend there wasn't so much data and solve.
3. Get real.
    - Go back to the real problem. What breaks?
4. Solve problems.
    - Solve the issues you just found.

Question: Given millions of documents, find all documents which contain a list of words.

1. Do the words need to be in a specific order?
2. Assume everything can fit on one machine.
3. Must split up data across machines.
4. Divide hash tables by file or by keyword?
- Once you know how to solve hash tables this is purely a problem solving question.

#### After Your Interview

- Follow up with your recruiter.
  - No response doesn't mean your application has been rejected.
  - Send a thank you email to your recruiter.
  - Follow up after a week, then a couple more before trying to phone in.
- You will have no idea how well/poorly you did 
- Lots of randomness in the whole process.
  - If you fail, try again.
  - Usually you can reapply in 6-12 months.
